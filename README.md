**434Mhz RF Wireless 4-Button Remote LED Control System**

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a wireless communication system using 433MHz RF Transmitter and Receiver modules with Arduino UNO.

The transmitter unit contains four push buttons (A, B, C, and D). Each button sends a unique RF code through the 433MHz RF transmitter module.

The receiver unit consists of an Arduino UNO, a 433MHz RF receiver module, and four LEDs. When a valid RF code is received, the Arduino decodes the signal and toggles the corresponding LED.

The system enables wireless control of multiple devices using a simple RF remote and can be extended for home automation, wireless switching, and embedded system applications.

## Working Principle

### Button A

When Button A is pressed on the transmitter side, RF Code A is transmitted through the 433MHz RF module.

The receiver receives and decodes the signal.

If the received code matches Code A, LED1 toggles ON/OFF.

---

### Button B

When Button B is pressed, RF Code B is transmitted.

The receiver decodes the received signal.

If the received code matches Code B, LED2 toggles ON/OFF.

---

### Button C

When Button C is pressed, RF Code C is transmitted.

The receiver verifies the received RF code.

If the received code matches Code C, LED3 toggles ON/OFF.

---

### Button D

When Button D is pressed, RF Code D is transmitted.

The receiver decodes the signal.

If the received code matches Code D, LED4 toggles ON/OFF.
